### Considerations
Thank you for taking the time to review this assignment. As I am currently a macOS user, it has come to my attention that I am unable to record macros for conditional formatting, and therefor some of the vba code for the conditional formatting may not be accurate. I used a windows computer via zoom screensharing to acheive the code I used in my solution, and I made some errors at that time, therefore it didn't translate well. For this I apologize!
